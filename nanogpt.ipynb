    "\n",
    "To transform text into a format that can be used by a neural net, we need to first tokenize it (That is, transform the text corpus into indexes of our dictionary). The GPT-2 model uses a byte-level BPE tokenizer. \n",

    "In the tutorial video above, you see that a BPE tokenizer starts with a base dictionary set of characters. Those \"base set of characters\" are usually represented by unicode characters. Unicode characters are the standard way to represent all possible human languages plus our favorite emojis 😀😙 in byte streams. There are multiple Unicode standards: UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, etc. However, because unicode characters are not very memory efficient, this basically means that we need to start with a **huge** base dictionary size to begin with our tokenizer. And this is why the authors of GPT-2 chose to instead use a byte-level BPE tokenizer. That is, we split characters into futher smaller fragments (1 byte, or 8-bits) and use those as our base dictionary. This way, we can reduce the base dictionary size from 100,000+ unicode characters to just 256.\n",
    "\n",
    "> As a side note, the UTF-8 standard is not a strict 8-bit-per-character standard and each character in a UTF-8 stream can take more than 8 bits. "

    "To implement a byte-level BPE tokenizer, we need to first create a base dictionary of 256 characters.

We will do this by implementing both the `expand_dictionary` method and the `find_combinations_to_expand` method.\n",

    "Basically, think about our current dictionary as all possible alphabets and a space. We would first tokenize our text into a list of indexes in our dictionary. Then we will enumerate through the list of indexes and find the most frequent pair of indexes that appear next to each other. We will then combine those two indexes (of the most frequent pair) into a new index and add it to our dictionary. We will repeat this process until we reach our desired vocabulary size.\n",

    "### Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Great job on implementing Part 1! In Part 2, we will implement the transformer layer. The first step in building the transformer layer is multi-head attention. Let's understand how attention works. The motivation behind attention is that some parts of our input data are more important than others. We only want to focus on the important parts of the data. The attention mechanism achieves this by using a set of queries, keys, and values generated from the input tokens. A similarity score is produced between a query $q_i$ and a key $k_j$ and higher similiarity scores means token $i$ should attend to token $j$ more. \n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-2 is an auto-regressive model (i.e. it predicts future tokens given previous data). GPT-2 uses masked attention because we want to mask the information about future tokens. If we had information about future tokens, this would be considered cheating because the model would know what to output. GPT-2 uses multi-headed attention, or multiple attention heads. Using multiple heads is useful because it enables the model to attend to parts of the sequence differently. You can think of it as enabling more expressivity in communication amongst tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we implement multi-headed attention head in the following steps:\n",
    "1. Generate queries, keys, and values from the input tokens (computed in the previous part)\n",
    "2. Use the queries, keys, and values to compute masked attention\n",
    "3. Apply a linear projection and dropout to the masked attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how attention is calculated: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Attention = Softmax(Mask(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_{head}}}))V\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $d_{head}$ is the embedding dimension of each head, $n_{heads}$ is the number of heads, and $d_{model} = n_{heads} * d_{head}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The input `x` is of size `(batch_size, seq_len, d_model)` and the output is of size `(batch_size, tgt_len, d_model)`. However, the attention function should take in queries of size `(batch_size, n_heads, tgt_len, d_head)` and keys and values of size `(batch_size, n_heads, seq_len, d_head)`. Thus, we need to rearrange the input and attention output somehow to match the different dimensions. Also note that for self-attention, `tgt_len == seq_len` since we are passing the input `x` as the queries, keys, and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint 1: `einops.rearrange` may be helpful here. You can reference the documentation here: https://einops.rocks/api/rearrange/. We've included the `einops` package for you already.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint 2: To apply the mask before applying softmax, we want to set the weights we want to mask out to $-inf$ so that softmax ignores those weights. We want something like $\\begin{bmatrix} W_{11} & -inf & -inf & ...\\\\ W_{21} & W_{22} & -inf & ...\\\\ W_{31} & W_{32} & W_{33} & ...\\\\ ... & ... & ... & ... \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$ where $W = \\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_{head}}}$. `torch.tril` and `torch.Tensor.masked_fill` may be helpful here.*\n",
